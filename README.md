Useful functions that I always use.

- Functions around the Internet. (might not be usefull for many people...)
- Functions for machine learning.

That's it for now.

Then in your python script, write

```

Done.

## Explanation of Repo Name

I usually think that functions and classes contained in [collections](https://docs.python.org/ja/3/library/collections.html), a default module in Python, is very useful, like Counter.
The base name of this repo comes from there.  
The "G" part comes from my favorite anime, "Symphogear".
The second series of the anime was titled "Symphogear G", and thats where the "G" came from : )  
It's sad to think that the whole anime series had ended, but I still believe that it will continue on somewhere else like in the theater...
